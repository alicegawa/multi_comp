n T x y z R P
n is an integer label that identifies the current point and increments by one from one line to the next.

T is an integer representing the type of neuronal segment, such as soma, axon, apical dendrite, etc. The standard accepted integer values are given below.

0 = undefined
1 = soma
2 = axon
3 = dendrite
4 = apical dendrite
5 = fork point
6 = end point
7 = custom
x, y, z gives the cartesian coordinates of each node.

R is the radius at that node.

P indicates the parent (the integer label) of the current point or -1 to indicate an origin (soma).
